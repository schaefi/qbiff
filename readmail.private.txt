This is the default qbiff folder script in private mode. When calling
qbiff with the --toggle option a small icon on the left side appears
additionally. If clicked the private mode is activated and the
script set by the --readpriv option or the default script
/usr/share/qbiff/readmail.private is called.

To replace this script with something more useful you can write your
own script or use the example below. The program called by qbiff
always receives the folder path/name as first parameter.

The following small scripts runs mutt on the requested mail folder

#!/bin/sh
title=`basename $1`

xterm +sb -T $title -e mutt -f $1

----------snap--------

Have Fun
